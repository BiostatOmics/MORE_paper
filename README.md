Maider Aguerralde-Martin, Mónica Clemente-Císcar, Ana Conesa, Sonia Tarazona

The MORE R package is available at <https://github.com/BiostatOmics/MORE>.

This repository contains the code used to generate the analyses and figures presented in the paper.  
The repository is organized into three main scripts, each described below:

#### MOSim_simulations
  
[MOSim_simulations](MOSim_simulations.R) Contains the code used to perform the simulations with MOSim tool. These simulations were used to benchmark MORE under different configurations and to compare it with other state-of-the-art tools.

#### paperFigures_MOSim
  
[paperFigures_MOSim](paperFigures_MOSim.R) Generates Figures 2 and 3, and Supplementary Figures S1, S2, and S3. These figures illustrate the performance of the various MORE methodologies on simulated MOSim data and compare then to other state-of-the-art-tools.

#### paperFigures_OVAdata  

[paperFigures_OVAdata](paperFigures_OVAdata.R) Generates Figures 4 and 5, and Supplementary Figures S4 and S5. These figures show the application of MORE to High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC) data.
